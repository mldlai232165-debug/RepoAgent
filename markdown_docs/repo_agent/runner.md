### FunctionDef get_all_pys(self, directory)
**get_all_pys**: get_all_pys的功能是获取指定目录下的所有Python文件。

**parameters**: 该函数的参数。
· directory: 需要搜索的目录，类型为字符串。

**Code Description**: get_all_pys函数用于遍历给定的目录，查找并返回该目录及其子目录下的所有Python文件的路径。函数首先初始化一个空列表python_files，用于存储找到的Python文件路径。接着，使用os.walk(directory)方法递归遍历指定目录。os.walk会返回一个生成器，生成器的每个元素都是一个三元组(root, dirs, files)，其中root是当前遍历到的目录路径，dirs是该目录下的子目录列表，files是该目录下的文件列表。函数随后对每个文件进行检查，如果文件名以“.py”结尾，则将该文件的完整路径（通过os.path.join(root, file)构建）添加到python_files列表中。最后，函数返回包含所有找到的Python文件路径的列表。

**Note**: 使用该函数时，请确保传入的directory参数是一个有效的目录路径。此外，确保在调用该函数之前已导入os模块，以避免运行时错误。

**Output Example**: 假设在指定目录下找到以下Python文件：
- /path/to/directory/script1.py
- /path/to/directory/subdirectory/script2.py

则该函数的返回值将是：
```python
[
    '/path/to/directory/script1.py',
    '/path/to/directory/subdirectory/script2.py'
]
```

### FunctionDef markdown_refresh(self)
**markdown_refresh**: The function of markdown_refresh is to write the latest document information into a markdown format folder, regardless of whether the markdown content has changed.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The markdown_refresh function is responsible for generating and updating markdown documentation for the project. It begins by acquiring a lock to ensure thread safety during the execution of the function. The first step is to delete any existing content in the markdown folder specified by the project settings. This is achieved using the shutil.rmtree method, which removes the directory and all its contents, followed by the creation of a new markdown folder.

Next, the function retrieves a list of all file items from the documentation hierarchy using the get_all_files method from the MetaInfo class. It iterates through each file item, checking whether it contains any documentation content using a recursive helper function named recursive_check. This function inspects the DocItem objects to determine if they have any markdown content or if their children contain markdown content.

If a file item does not contain any documentation, it is skipped. For file items that do contain documentation, the function constructs the markdown content using another helper function called to_markdown. This function generates the markdown representation of the DocItem and its children, formatting the output according to the hierarchical structure of the documentation.

Once the markdown content is generated, it is written to a .md file in the markdown folder. The file path is constructed by replacing the .py extension of the file item with .md. The function ensures that the necessary directories are created before writing the markdown content to the file.

Finally, the function logs an informational message indicating that the markdown documents have been refreshed successfully.

The markdown_refresh function is called within the first_generate method and the run method of the Runner class. In first_generate, it is used to refresh the markdown documentation after generating all documents for the first time. In the run method, it is invoked after processing changes to ensure that the markdown documentation is up to date with the latest changes in the project.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the project settings are correctly configured, and that the target repository is accessible. The function assumes that the markdown folder is specified in the project settings and that the necessary permissions are in place for file operations.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the markdown_refresh function could be a markdown file structured as follows:

# Class Example
This is the documentation for the Example class.

## Method example_method
This method does something important.

### Parameters
- param1: Description of parameter 1.
- param2: Description of parameter 2.

*** 

This structure would be repeated for each documented item, providing a clear and organized representation of the project's documentation in markdown format.
#### FunctionDef recursive_check(doc_item)
**recursive_check**: The function of recursive_check is to determine whether a given documentation item contains any Markdown content or if any of its child items contain Markdown content.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· doc_item: An instance of the DocItem class, representing the documentation item to be checked.

**Code Description**: The recursive_check function operates by first checking if the provided DocItem instance, referred to as doc_item, has any Markdown content stored in its md_content attribute. If this attribute is not empty (i.e., it contains one or more Markdown entries), the function immediately returns True, indicating that the documentation item has associated content.

If the md_content attribute is empty, the function proceeds to iterate through the children of the doc_item. The children are stored in the children attribute, which is a dictionary mapping child object names to their corresponding DocItem instances. For each child DocItem, the recursive_check function is called recursively. If any child returns True, indicating that it contains Markdown content, the parent function will also return True.

If neither the doc_item nor any of its children contain Markdown content, the function ultimately returns False. This recursive approach allows the function to traverse the entire hierarchy of documentation items, ensuring that all levels are checked for content.

The recursive_check function is closely related to the DocItem class, which encapsulates the metadata and relationships of documentation items within a project. The function leverages the hierarchical structure established by the DocItem instances to perform its checks effectively. 

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the doc_item passed to the recursive_check function is a valid instance of the DocItem class, as the function relies on the attributes defined within this class to perform its checks accurately.

**Output Example**: If a DocItem instance has Markdown content, the function would return True. Conversely, if it and all its children lack Markdown content, the function would return False. For instance, if doc_item.md_content is an empty list and all children also have empty md_content, the output would be:
False

#### FunctionDef to_markdown(item, now_level)
**to_markdown**: The function of to_markdown is to generate a Markdown representation of a documentation item and its children.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· item: An instance of DocItem, representing the documentation item to be converted to Markdown.
· now_level: An integer indicating the current level of the documentation item in the hierarchy, which affects the Markdown heading level.

**Code Description**: The to_markdown function constructs a Markdown string that represents a given documentation item (DocItem) and its hierarchical children. It begins by initializing an empty string called markdown_content. The function then appends a header to this string, which consists of a number of hash symbols corresponding to the now_level parameter, followed by the string representation of the item's type (obtained by calling the to_str method on item.item_type) and the object's name (item.obj_name).

If the item contains parameters (checked by verifying the presence of "params" in item.content and ensuring it has a length greater than zero), these parameters are formatted and appended to the markdown_content string in parentheses. Following this, the function adds the last entry from item.md_content to the markdown_content, or a placeholder message if md_content is empty.

The function then iterates over the children of the current item (item.children), recursively calling to_markdown for each child with an incremented now_level. Each child's Markdown output is appended to the markdown_content, separated by a line of asterisks for clarity.

Finally, the complete markdown_content string is returned, providing a structured Markdown representation of the documentation item and its children.

This function relies on the DocItem class, which encapsulates the metadata and relationships of documentation items, and the DocItemType class, which provides the to_str method to convert item types into string representations. The to_markdown function is essential for generating readable documentation in Markdown format, facilitating better understanding and accessibility of the project's documentation structure.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the DocItem instances are properly structured and that their content is accurately populated to avoid incomplete or misleading documentation output.

**Output Example**: An example output of the to_markdown function for a DocItem representing a function might look like this:
```
## FunctionDef my_function_name (param1, param2)
This function does something important...
***
### FunctionDef my_child_function_name
This child function does something else...

### FunctionDef git_commit(self, commit_message)
**git_commit**: git_commit的功能是执行一个Git提交操作，使用指定的提交信息。

**parameters**: 该函数的参数。
· commit_message: 提交信息，用于描述本次提交的内容。

**Code Description**: git_commit函数用于在Git版本控制系统中执行提交操作。该函数接受一个参数commit_message，表示提交的描述信息。函数内部使用subprocess模块调用系统命令行，执行`git commit`命令。具体来说，使用`subprocess.check_call`方法来运行命令，命令的参数包括`--no-verify`选项，表示在提交时跳过钩子验证，和`-m`选项后跟提交信息。若在执行过程中发生错误，函数会捕获subprocess.CalledProcessError异常，并打印出错误信息，提示用户提交操作失败的原因。

**Note**: 使用该函数时，请确保已在正确的Git仓库目录下，并且有未提交的更改。同时，注意commit_message应为有效的字符串，以便清晰地描述提交内容。

### FunctionDef get_new_objects(self, file_handler)
**get_new_objects**: The function of get_new_objects is to identify and return the newly added and deleted objects by comparing the current and previous versions of a Python file.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_handler: An instance of the FileHandler class, responsible for managing file operations and retrieving file versions.

**Code Description**: The get_new_objects function is designed to analyze the differences between the current and previous versions of a Python file. It utilizes the file_handler parameter to access the modified file versions and extract the functions and classes defined in both versions. 

The function begins by calling the method get_modified_file_versions on the file_handler object, which returns the current and previous versions of the file. It then retrieves the functions and classes from both versions using the get_functions_and_classes method. If there is no previous version, it initializes parse_previous_py as an empty list.

Next, the function constructs two sets: current_obj and previous_obj, which contain the names of the objects (functions and classes) from the current and previous versions, respectively. By performing set operations, it calculates the newly added objects (new_obj) and the deleted objects (del_obj). The function returns these two lists as a tuple.

This function is called by the update_existing_item method within the same class. The update_existing_item method is responsible for updating the file structure information based on changes detected in the Python file. It utilizes the output of get_new_objects to determine which objects have been added or deleted, allowing it to update the file_dict accordingly. Specifically, it removes any deleted objects from the file_dict and updates the information of existing objects based on the current version of the file.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file_handler object passed to this function is properly initialized and contains the necessary methods for retrieving file versions and parsing the file content.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
new_obj: ['add_context_stack', '__init__']
del_obj: []
