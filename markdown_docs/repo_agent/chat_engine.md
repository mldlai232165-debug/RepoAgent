## ClassDef ChatEngine
Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef __init__(self, project_manager)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the ChatEngine class with the necessary configuration settings for the OpenAI API.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· project_manager: An instance of the ProjectManager class that is responsible for managing the overall project workflow and interactions.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method of the ChatEngine class is designed to set up the initial state of the ChatEngine instance by configuring it with the appropriate settings for the OpenAI API. Upon instantiation, the method first retrieves the current configuration settings by calling the `get_setting` method from the SettingsManager class. This method ensures that the settings are accessed in a consistent manner throughout the application, adhering to the Singleton design pattern.

The retrieved settings include critical parameters such as the OpenAI API key, the base URL for API requests, the timeout duration for requests, the model to be used for chat completions, and the temperature setting that influences the randomness of the generated responses. These parameters are essential for the ChatEngine to function correctly and interact with the OpenAI API effectively.

The OpenAI instance is then created using these settings, allowing the ChatEngine to perform chat-related functionalities, such as generating responses based on user input. The integration of the SettingsManager ensures that the ChatEngine is always configured with the latest settings, promoting maintainability and reducing the risk of errors due to misconfiguration.

From a functional perspective, the ChatEngine class relies on the SettingsManager to provide the necessary configuration settings, which are crucial for its operation. This relationship exemplifies the design principle of separation of concerns, where the SettingsManager handles the management of configuration settings, while the ChatEngine focuses on its primary functionality of facilitating chat interactions.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the SettingsManager is properly configured and that the Setting class contains valid attributes before instantiating the ChatEngine. Any misconfiguration may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the ChatEngine attempts to utilize the OpenAI API settings.

#### FunctionDef get_referenced_prompt(doc_item)
**get_referenced_prompt**: The function of get_referenced_prompt is to generate a formatted string that summarizes the references made by a given DocItem, including details about the referenced objects and their documentation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· doc_item: An instance of the DocItem class, which contains information about the documentation item and its references.

**Code Description**: The get_referenced_prompt function is designed to create a prompt that outlines the references associated with a specific DocItem. It first checks if the provided doc_item has any references by evaluating the length of the reference_who attribute, which is a list of DocItem instances that reference the current item. If there are no references, the function returns an empty string.

If references are present, the function initializes a list called prompt with a predefined introductory string. It then iterates over each reference_item in the doc_item.reference_who list. For each reference_item, the function constructs a detailed string (instance_prompt) that includes the full name of the referenced object, its corresponding documentation content, and the raw code associated with it. The get_full_name method of the reference_item is called to retrieve its full hierarchical name, ensuring clarity in the context of the documentation.

The instance_prompt is formatted to include the object's name, its documentation (if available), and the raw code, all separated by a visual divider. Each instance_prompt is appended to the prompt list. Finally, the function joins all elements of the prompt list into a single string, separated by newline characters, and returns this string.

This function is particularly useful in the context of generating documentation, as it provides a clear overview of how different documentation items are interconnected through references. It aids in understanding the relationships between various code elements, which is essential for maintaining comprehensive and accurate documentation.

**Note**: When using the get_referenced_prompt function, ensure that the doc_item passed to it has been properly initialized and contains valid references. This will guarantee that the generated prompt accurately reflects the relationships and documentation of the referenced items.

**Output Example**: An example output of the get_referenced_prompt function for a DocItem with references might look like this:
```
As you can see, the code calls the following objects, their code and docs are as following:
obj: repo_agent/doc_meta_info.py/DocItem
Document: 
**DocItem**: The function of DocItem is to represent individual documentation items within a project, encapsulating their metadata and relationships.
Raw code:```
class DocItem:
    ...
```
obj: repo_agent/another_file.py/AnotherClass
Document: 
**AnotherClass**: This class serves a different purpose within the project.
Raw code:```
class AnotherClass:
    ...
```
```

#### FunctionDef get_referencer_prompt(doc_item)
**get_referencer_prompt**: The function of get_referencer_prompt is to generate a prompt string that lists all the objects that reference a given documentation item, along with their associated documentation and code.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· doc_item: An instance of the DocItem class, which represents the documentation item for which the referencing objects are being retrieved.

**Code Description**: The get_referencer_prompt function is designed to create a formatted string that provides information about the objects that reference a specific documentation item. It begins by checking if the provided doc_item has any references in its who_reference_me attribute, which is a list of DocItem instances that reference the current item. If this list is empty, the function returns an empty string, indicating that there are no references to display.

If there are references, the function initializes a prompt list with a header string that introduces the subsequent information. It then iterates over each DocItem in the who_reference_me list. For each referencing item, it constructs a detailed string that includes the full name of the referencing object (obtained by calling the get_full_name method on the referencer_item), the last version of its markdown content (if available), and its raw code content (if present). Each of these details is formatted in a readable manner, separated by line breaks and a visual divider.

Finally, the function joins all the strings in the prompt list into a single string, separated by newline characters, and returns this formatted string. This output serves as a comprehensive reference for developers, allowing them to quickly understand which objects are related to the given documentation item and to access their associated documentation and code.

The get_referencer_prompt function is particularly useful in the context of documentation generation and management, as it helps to clarify the relationships between different code elements. By providing a clear overview of the references, it aids developers in navigating the documentation and understanding the dependencies within the codebase.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the doc_item parameter is a properly initialized instance of the DocItem class with an established hierarchy and references. This will ensure accurate and meaningful output.

**Output Example**: An example output of the get_referencer_prompt function might look like this:
```
Also, the code has been called by the following objects, their code and docs are as following:
obj: repo_agent/doc_meta_info.py/DocItem
