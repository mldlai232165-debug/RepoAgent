## ClassDef InterceptHandler
**InterceptHandler**: The function of InterceptHandler is to redirect standard logging output to the Loguru logging system.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· record: logging.LogRecord - This parameter represents the log record containing all the information pertinent to the event being logged.

**Code Description**: The InterceptHandler class extends the logging.Handler class to facilitate the integration of Python's standard logging module with the Loguru logging system. The primary method of this class is `emit`, which is responsible for processing log records. 

When a log record is received, the `emit` method first attempts to map the standard logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING) to the corresponding Loguru level. If the mapping fails, it defaults to using the numeric level of the log record. This ensures that all log messages are appropriately categorized according to their severity.

Next, the method identifies the caller of the log message by traversing the call stack. It uses the `inspect.currentframe()` function to obtain the current stack frame and iterates through the frames to find the origin of the log message. This is particularly useful for debugging, as it provides context about where the log message was generated.

Finally, the method logs the message using Loguru's logging capabilities, including any exception information if present. The `logger.opt()` method is utilized to set the depth of the stack trace and to include exception details, ensuring that the log output is informative and relevant.

The InterceptHandler is specifically invoked within the `set_logger_level_from_config` function. This function configures the Loguru logger with a specified log level and integrates it with the standard logging module. By calling `logging.basicConfig()` with an instance of InterceptHandler, it effectively redirects all standard logging output to Loguru, allowing for a unified logging approach across the application. This integration is crucial for maintaining consistent logging behavior, especially in applications that utilize both standard logging and Loguru.

**Note**: When using the InterceptHandler, it is important to ensure that the logging configuration is set up correctly to avoid conflicts between standard logging and Loguru. Additionally, developers should be aware of the performance implications of logging, particularly in multi-threaded environments, where the `enqueue=True` option in Loguru can help manage log messages safely.
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: emit函数的功能是将日志记录发送到Loguru日志系统。

**parameters**: 该函数的参数。
· record: logging.LogRecord - 包含日志记录信息的对象。

**Code Description**: emit函数首先尝试获取与传入的日志记录的级别相对应的Loguru级别。如果成功，则使用该级别；如果失败，则使用记录的级别号。接着，函数通过inspect模块获取当前调用栈的帧信息，以确定日志消息的来源。它会遍历调用栈，直到找到一个非logging模块的帧，从而确定日志消息的深度。最后，使用Loguru的logger对象，结合深度和异常信息，记录日志消息。

具体步骤如下：
1. 使用logger.level方法获取与record.levelname对应的Loguru级别名称。如果该级别不存在，则使用record.levelno作为级别。
2. 通过inspect.currentframe()获取当前帧，并初始化深度为0。然后，使用while循环遍历调用栈，直到找到一个非logging模块的帧。
3. 使用logger.opt方法记录日志，传入深度和异常信息，并调用record.getMessage()获取日志消息的内容。

**Note**: 使用该函数时，请确保传入的record对象是有效的logging.LogRecord实例，以避免潜在的错误。同时，确保Loguru库已正确配置，以便能够处理日志记录。

## FunctionDef set_logger_level_from_config(log_level)
**set_logger_level_from_config**: The function of set_logger_level_from_config is to configure the loguru logger with a specified log level and integrate it with the standard logging module.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· log_level: str - The log level to set for loguru (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING").

**Code Description**: The set_logger_level_from_config function is designed to set the logging level for the loguru logger based on the provided log_level argument. It begins by removing any existing loguru handlers to ensure that there are no conflicts or duplications in logging output. Following this, it adds a new handler to the loguru logger that directs output to stderr at the specified log level. The parameters `enqueue=True`, `backtrace=False`, and `diagnose=False` are used to ensure that logging is thread-safe, minimizes detailed traceback information, and suppresses additional diagnostic information, respectively.

Additionally, the function redirects the standard logging output to the loguru logger by utilizing the InterceptHandler class. This integration allows loguru to handle all logging consistently across the application, which is particularly useful in scenarios where both standard logging and loguru are used. The function concludes by logging a success message indicating that the log level has been set.

The set_logger_level_from_config function is called within the run function located in the repo_agent/main.py file. In this context, it retrieves the logging configuration from the SettingsManager and applies it by calling set_logger_level_from_config with the appropriate log level. This ensures that the logging configuration is established before any tasks are executed, allowing for consistent logging behavior throughout the application.

**Note**: When using the set_logger_level_from_config function, it is essential to ensure that the logging configuration is correctly set up to avoid conflicts between standard logging and loguru. Developers should also consider the implications of logging performance, especially in multi-threaded environments, where the `enqueue=True` option can help manage log messages safely.
